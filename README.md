# Module 11: UFO Sightings

## Overview
We have been tasked to build a webpage with a dynamic table that allows a user to query data on UFO sightings. The user must be able to search based on multiple criteria. The skills required for this task include knowledge of html, css, and javascript. 

## Results
The current setup of the website allows a user to query the data table based on a variety of criteria including date, city, state, country, and shape. The user can also use the filters to search multiple criteria at the same time. For example, all UFO sightings in “nj” on “1/5/2010”.

## Summary
There are a couple of drawbacks to this initial design. The most obvious is the need for pagination so that the webpage doesn’t span the entire length of the table. Another drawback is the multiple search bars; ideally there would be one search bar and/or a combination of dropdown options to filter and sort table columns. A map that displayed where the UFO sightings have taken place would be helpful for those not familiar with where geographically these cities are located. The map could filter based on search criteria as well so that it is dynamic like the table. Lastly, the filtering capabilities should be expanded so that a user could enter a date range or search multiple UFO shapes at one time.
